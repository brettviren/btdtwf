#+title: Been There Done That Workflow

The =btdtwf= package provides simple ways to organize workflows.  

The packages has these components:

 - fnwf :: functional network workflow, a high-level workflow organization and execution data structure.  See [[./doc/fnwf.org]] for more info.
 - got :: Git Object tracker, a git-based file store

Some other, abandoned approaches based on =pyutilib= and =bein= are kept around in the [[./doc/pube]].
